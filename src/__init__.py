# __init__.py

# This file can be empty, or it can contain initialization code.
# It is executed when the package is imported.

# For example, you might use it to define package-level variables or
# to import modules that should be available when the package is imported.

# If the file is left empty, the package is still recognized by Python,
# but it doesn't perform any specific initialization when imported.
