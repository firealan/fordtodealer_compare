# Data Scraping Ford Vehicles

## Overview

This project scrapes Ford vehicle prices and hero images from Ford's official website (www.ford.ca) and its affiliate dealer website (www.fordtodealers.ca), to compare vehicle prices and hero images in a tabular format, and sends that information in an email.

This notification is meant for the recipeient to ensure that the prices on both sites are in sync.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script locally, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed
- Chrome, Firefox, or Edge browser installed
- ChromeDriver downloaded and configured (see instructions below)
- Required Python modules installed (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- A Gmail account for sending email notifications
- Docker Desktop (optional) to create a docker image and container

## ChromeDriver Setup

NOTE: The `webdriver_manager` package is part of this application and installs the browser driver on-demand which means downloading the drivers are not neccessary.

1. **Download ChromeDriver:**
   Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver for your Chrome browser version. You can download it from [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).

2. **Set ChromeDriver Path:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add the following line:
   - Replace `/path/to/chromedriver.exe` with the actual path to your downloaded `chromedriver.exe`.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/firealan/fordtodealer_compare.git
cd fordtodealer_compare
```

2. **Install Python Modules:**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Create .env and update the given values file:**

Create the .env file in the root folder. Ensure the following environment variables are set in your .env file:

```
# Selenium configuration - Webdriver for Firefox via Github
GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pac_token

# Email configuration
EMAIL_ERROR_RECIEVER=admin@email.com
EMAIL_SENDER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_RECIEVER=recipient-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-password
```

### Selenium configuration

- GITHUB_TOKEN = The webdriver_manager downloads some webdrivers from their official GitHub repositories but GitHub has rate limitations in place. An unauthenticated user gets 60 requests per hours. Create a PAC token in Github, and place the value here as authenticated users rate limit is 5000 requests per hour. Follow the insturctions in the [Github link](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to create PAC token.

### Email configuration

- EMAIL_ERROR_RECIEVER = These are the emails you would like to send emails to for application failures. It is a comma delimited string format that can contain a single email `recipient-email@gmail.com` or multiple `recipient1-email@gmail.com,recipient2-email@gmail.com`.

- EMAIL_SENDER = This is the email you are sending the email notification from i.e. youremail@gmail.com. This is also used as the login credentials for Gmail.

- EMAIL_RECIEVER = These are the emails you would like to send emails to. It is a comma delimited string format that can contain a single email `recipient-email@gmail.com` or multiple `recipient1-email@gmail.com,recipient2-email@gmail.com`.

- EMAIL_PASSWORD = This application uses Google gmail to send the email notifcation. In order to send an email, a App Password needs to be created by the gmail account sending the email. It is a 16 character string that needs to be set here. Follow the instruction in the [Google link](https://knowledge.workspace.google.com/kb/how-to-create-app-passwords-000009237) to create an app password.

### URL configuration

The URL's listed here are for the individual vehicle page that contains the vehicle trim prices and hero image. There might be some cases where the pricing is a different url than the hero image thus allowing you to specify where either will be.

The pattern is:

```
<vehicle_model>_SKIP_FLAG=<boolean>
<vehicle_model>_MANUFACTURER_URL=<url>
<vehicle_model>_MANUFACTURER_IMAGE_URL=<url>
<vehicle_model>_DEALER_URL=<url>
<vehicle_model>_DEALER_IMAGE_URL=<url>
```

Example for Bronco Sport vehicle:

```
BRONCO_SPORT_SKIP_FLAG=false
BRONCO_SPORT_MANUFACTURER_URL=https://www.ford.ca/suvs/bronco-sport/models/?gnav=vhpnav-specs
BRONCO_SPORT_MANUFACTURER_IMAGE_URL=https://www.ford.ca/suvs/bronco-sport/?gnav=vhpnav-overiew
BRONCO_SPORT_DEALER_URL=https://fordtodealers.ca/ford-bronco-sport/
BRONCO_SPORT_DEALER_IMAGE_URL=https://fordtodealers.ca/ford-bronco-sport/
```

### constants.py - Vehicle URL's

The `constants.py` file holds the URL's, Web Driver configs, and skip flags that enable selecting specific vehicle data to be web scrapped.

- BROWSER_DRIVER_TYPE = Set this value to the browser you would like to use. Currently the supported browsers are `chrome`, `edge`, and `firefox`. These browsers need to be installed on the host machine that this application runs on.

- HEADLESS_MODE = The value is either `true` (enable headless browsing) or `false` (disable headless browsing).

- SKIP_FLAG = The value is either `true` (disables web scrapping) or `false` (enables web scrapping).

4. **Create Python .venv for the project:**

In VS Code, it is a good idea to create a python virtual environemnt so all the project dependencies are contained within for a cleaner development space.

To create a virtual environment for the project please follow the instructions in the [Visual Studio link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) - creating environments.

## Docker - Optional Step

This project contains a Docker file to be able to create a Docker image and container to run independent of host computer requirements. In otherwords, the container will hold **ALL** dependencies required for the python application to run.

1. **Install Docker Desktop:**

Install Docker desktop on the host machine. It can be [found here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

2. **Build Docker Image**

In your terminal run the following:

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will build a local image using the .env file at run time to passs in environment variables.

3. **Build Docker Image to push to Docker Hub**

```
docker build -t neallyboy/ford-web-scrapper .
```

This will build a new local image with the proper tag syntax in order to push properly to Docker Hub

4. **Push image to Docker Hub Repo**

```
docker push neallyboy/ford-web-scrapper
```

This will push the `neallyboy/ford-web-scrapper` image to the Docker Hub repo so that it can be available in the cloud.

5. **Pull the image from Docker Hub to your local machine**

```
docker pull neallyboy/ford-web-scrapper
```

This will pull the latest version from Docker Hub from the `neallyboy` repo.


6. **Verify docker image architecture**

```
docker image inspect neallyboy/ford-web-scrapper --format '{{.Os}}/{{.Architecture}}'
```

In some cases, depending on how you build the image, can affect the image architecture.

The default architecture types for Docker images, if not explicitly specified during the build process, are as follows:

- **Windows**: `windows/amd64`
- **Linux**: `linux/amd64`
- **Mac (Intel-based)**: `linux/amd64`
- **Mac (Apple Silicon/M1/M2)**: `linux/arm64`

Docker automatically detects the host system's architecture and builds the image accordingly unless overridden using the `--platform` flag during the build process. For example:

```
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t neallyboy/ford-web-scrapper .
```

## Building Docker Images - docker build vs docker buildx

Using `docker buildx` allows you to build multi-platform Docker images, which is particularly useful when you want to target architectures other than the one your host system is running on. The key difference between `docker build` and `docker buildx` is that `buildx` provides extended functionality, such as:

- **Multi-platform builds**: Build images for multiple architectures (e.g., `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) in a single command.
- **Cross-compilation**: Build images for architectures different from your host system without needing emulation or a physical machine for that architecture.
- **Advanced caching**: Better caching mechanisms for faster builds.

### Example Command Using `buildx`

Hereâ€™s how you can use `docker buildx` to build your image for a specific platform:

```
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t neallyboy/ford-web-scrapper .
```

## Azure Cloud Instances - Optional

Azure Cloud Instances (ACI) allows you to create simple containers that are responsible. In this case, we would like to run the container on a schedule, and only have the container live for the life of the script.

Once create, you cannot re-configure it. For example, the python application require environment variables to be passed to it. When creating the ACI, you can only set the variables at creation, it cannot be changed after that. This requires you to delete and recreate the container if you would like to change the environment variable value to something else.

```
az container delete --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-container-group>
```
This command will delete the container so you can change the environment variables later.


If if thes first time, then create a new container instance in the cloud.

```
az container create --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-container-group> --file <your-yaml-file>
```

## Logic App - Optional

The ACI does not have built-in functionality to schedule when a container can start. We need a different Azure resource to be used to schedule container runs. In this case, we use Logic App to start the Azure Container Instance. The Logic App has a scheduled trigger to that you can configure the time you would like it to start.

It essentialy has just 2 stpes.

1. Create an occurance trigger. This will be the first step where we can schedule a trigger to start the container. In our case, it will be daily at 7AM.
2. Create a task for starting a container group. This step will need to be configured to connect to the ACI, so it can see the container we want to start.

Now we have all we need to start run our container on a scheduled basis.

## Run the Script Locally

```
python main.py
```

This will run the script locally, and will scrape Ford vehicle models, prices, and hero immages, compare them, generate an HTML email, and send it to the specified email address.

## Adding a new vehicle

Add new lines in the constants.py file

```
<vehicle_model>_SKIP_FLAG=<boolean>
<vehicle_model>_MANUFACTURER_URL=<url>
<vehicle_model>_MANUFACTURER_IMAGE_URL=<url>
<vehicle_model>_DEALER_URL=<url>
<vehicle_model>_DEALER_IMAGE_URL=<url>
```

Then add the new vehicle in the following project structure:

```
my_project/
|-- src/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- mustang_vehicles.py
|   |-- <new_vehicles>.py
|   |-- utilities/
|       |-- __init__.py
|       |-- constants.py
```

Then add the logic to pick out the web elements that hold the vehicle model name, price, and hero image within the `<new_vehicles>.py` file.

It will be easier to copy an existing file, like `mustang_vehicles.py`, and rename it to the `<new_vehicles>.py` and adjusting the XPATH that target the specific information that is needed.

## Windows Scheduler - Schedule Docker Container Run

To schedule the docker container to run locally in a Windows machine, do the following:

1. Open Task Scheduler. You can do this by searching for "Task Scheduler" in the Start menu.

2. In the Task Scheduler, click on "Create Basic Task...".

3. Enter a name and a description for the task and click "Next".

4. Choose "Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly", or "One time", depending on how often you want the task to run, and click "Next".

5. Set the start time and date for the task and click "Next".

6. Choose "Start a program" and click "Next".

7. In the "Program/script" field, enter the path to your Docker Compose executable. This is typically "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin\docker-compose.exe".

8. In the "Add arguments (optional)" field, enter the command you want to run. For example, to start a Docker Compose service, you might enter "up -d".

9. In the "Start in (optional)" field, enter the path to the directory that contains your Docker Compose file.

10. Click "Next" and then "Finish".
